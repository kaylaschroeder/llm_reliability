Link the statements to the assumptions.\nWe can link each statement to the appropriate assumption as follows:\n(s) Sherrie tells the truth\n(v)", "one about Elanor (e). This makes the problem almost symmetrical. This is important because it means that we can use the law of symmetry to solve the problem.\n2. Apply the Law of Symmetry.\nThe law of symmetry", "two about Michaela (m). As a result, the number of possibilities is 2^5 = 32.\n2. Eliminate impossible possibilities.\nThe first thing you must do is eliminate the cases in which Elanor", "one about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (E).\n2. Derive the implications.\nFrom these assumptions, we can derive the following implications:\n(s) => (v)\n(a) => ~", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e). The reason for this is that we are dealing with a problem that has multiple parts, and we need to make sure that we are considering all the relevant information.\nNow, let", "two about Michaela (m). This suggests that we need to understand the relationship between these assumptions.\n2. Understand the relationship between the assumptions.\nThe relationship between the statements can be described as follows:\nIf Sherrie (s)", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relationships.\n(s) is true.\n(v) is true if (s) is true.\n(a) is false if (", "Michaela (m), but only one about Elanor (e). This suggests that Elanor's statement is the most important, because it is the one that affects the most other statements.\n2. Determine the implications of each", "one about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Eliminate the obvious contradictions.\nThe statements (v) and (c) contradict each other. Since Vernell says Sherrie tells the", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (E). This is important because it shows that the question is unbalanced.\n2. Create an argument.\nThe argument that Elanor tells the truth can be created from the", "two about Michaela (m), but there is only one assumption about Elanor (e). So, in order to find out whether Elanor tells the truth (e), we really only need to know about her and Sherrie.", "one about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Determine the truth value of the assumptions.\nSince we are assuming that Sherrie, Vernell and Alexis tell the truth, we can conclude that all of", "two about Michaela (m). This means that there are four assumptions about Alexis and four about Michaela.\n2. Create a logical structure.\nIn order to create a logical structure for these assumptions, we need to use logical connectives", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the rules.\nThe rules that allow us to get from the assumptions to the conclusions are:\n(r1) If s is true, then v", "one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relevant relationships between these assumptions.\nThe relevant relationships are:\n- If s is true, then v is true (Sherrie says Sherrie tells the truth)\n-", "one about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Determine which statements are true based on the others:\n- (s) is true by assumption.\n- (v) is true based on (s)", "Michaela (m), but none about Elanor (e). Since there is a symmetry between the statements about Sherrie and Vernell, and between the statements about Alexis and Michaela, we can assume that the same rules apply to both", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Combine the assumptions to make statements we know are true.\nWe can combine the assumptions to make the following statements:\n(s) Sherrie tells the truth", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to build a logical chain of reasoning.\nWe can use these assumptions to build a logical chain of reasoning to get to the answer. I will describe", "Michaela (m) and only one about Elanor (e). This means that the answer can depend only on the statements about Sherrie and Vernell.\n2. Use the assumptions to construct a logical argument.\nThe argument is:", "two about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\nThe question asks you to determine whether Elanor is telling the truth. In order to answer that, you need to be able to find out what the truth is", "Michaela (m), but there is only one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to create a logical graph.\nA logical graph is a diagram that shows how the different statements relate to one another. The graph", "two about Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. The rules that should be followed.\n(s) and (v) tell us that Alexis is lying about Vernell because she says he tells the", "Michaela (m), and finally, there is one assumption about Elanor (e). Each assumption is about a different person.\n2. Determine the logical implications of the assumptions.\nFrom the assumption that Sherrie tells the truth,", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to construct a logical argument.\nThe argument is as follows:\n(a) s\n(b) v(s)\n(c)", "only one about each of the other two people.\n2. Create a network of relationships.\nUsing the assumptions, we can create a network of relationships that show the way these people are related to each other:\n(s) ---> (", "one about each of Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Analyze the implications of the statements.\nThe implications are the conclusions that follow from the statements. For example, from (a), it follows that", "two about Michaela (m), but there is no assumptions about Elanor except the statement that Elanor says Michaela tells the truth.\n2. Build the model.\nWe have to look at the relationships between the statements. The", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Check the assumptions for consistency.\nTo check for consistency, we have to check whether any of the assumptions contradict each other. The first assumption (s) is", "two about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e), respectively.\n2. Identify any logical inconsistencies.\nThere is a logical inconsistency between assumption (c) and assumption (d). Since Alexis says Vern", "two about Michaela (m). This is because Alexis and Michaela say two different things about Vernell and Sherrie, respectively. Elanor only says one thing about Michaela (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to answer the", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the logical inferences.\nWe can infer the following from the assumptions:\n(a) v => s (Vernell says Sherrie tells the", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to generate inferences.\nThe inferences are the statements that follow by applying the rules of logic to the premises. The following are the in", "two about Michaela (m).\n2. Construct the truth table\nA truth table is an organized record of all possible valuables of a number of logical variables for which the logical expression may take a true or false value. The truth table", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relations between the assumptions.\nThe relationships between the assumptions must be established in order to solve the problem. They are as follows:\n(s)", "Michaela (m), and two assumptions about Elanor (e).\n2. Determine the implications of the assumptions.\nThe implications are the logical conclusions that can be drawn from these assumptions. Implication (i) is that if Sher", "one about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e). \n2. Build the relationships between these assumptions.\n(a) Sherrie's truthfulness is assumed independently from Vernell's statements.\n(b", "Michaela (m). There is only one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Make a list of the facts.\nThe facts are the statements that are explicitly told and can be relied upon. In this case the facts are", "Michaela (m), and only one about Elanor (e).\n2. Check for contradictions.\nAn assumption contradicts another if the two statements cannot both be true. In this case, none of the assumptions contradict each other", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e). There are no assumptions about Alexis or Michaela, except for the ones given in the question. There are also no assumptions about Elanor.\n2. Understand the", "two about Michaela (m) and only one about Elanor (e). The question asks whether Elanor is telling the truth.\n2. Follow the logic.\nThere are two cases to consider:\n(i) If Sher", "two about Michaela (m). This means that there must be some consistency in the truthfulness of the statements.\n\n2. Analyze the consistency of the statements.\nIf Sherrie is telling the truth, then Vernell must also", "Michaela (m).\n2. Evaluate these assumptions.\nYou must analyze these assumptions in order to determine whether they are true or false.\n(a) Sherrie tells the truth\n(b) Vernell says Sherrie tells the", "two about Michaela (m), but each assumption is about the opposite of the other. That means that the truth of one implies the falsity of the other, and vice versa. So, for example, if (a) is true,", "one about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e). \n2. Eliminate contradictions.\nBy the process of elimination, we can determine which assumptions are valid. We can see that Sherrie (s", "two about Michaela (m). Notice that the statements are paired: In each pair, one person says something about the other person.\n2. Examine the logic.\nLooking at the statements, you can organize them in a way", "one about Michaela (m), but only one about Elanor (e).\n2. Check the assumptions.\nNow that we know what the assumptions are, let's check if they are true. First, Sherrie tells the truth", "three about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Organize the assumptions.\nYou should organize the assumptions in a way that makes it easy to see their relationships. The best way to do that is to use a", "two about Elanor (EL).\n\n2. Analyze the relationship between these assumptions.\nThe relationship among the assumptions is such that\n(a) s\n(b) v\n(c) ~a\n(d)", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Determine the relationships between the statements.\n(a) s\n(b) v(s)\n(c) ~a(v)\n(d", "two about Michaela (m), but only one about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to deduce the logical conclusions.\nThe first assumption leads to the conclusion that Sherrie is telling the truth. The second leads to", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Create a truth table for Sherrie and Vernell.\nThe truth table allows us to see how the truth values of the statements about Sherrie and Vernell change", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relationships between the assumptions.\n(a) v = s\n(b) v = s (restatement of a)\n(c)", "two about Michaela (m), but there is only one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Check for consistency.\nAn assumption must be consistent with every other assumption. For example, if (a) Sherrie tells the truth", "Michaela (m). Therefore, if we have the right number of statements about Sherrie and Vernell that tell the truth, and the right number of statements about Alexis and Michaela that tell the truth, we can make the correct conclusion.", "Michaela (m). There are also two assumptions about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to derive the answer.\nAssumption (a) means that whenever Sherrie tells the truth (s), there is a truth", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n\n2. Identify the statements that are dependent on previous statements.\nSome statements can only be made if certain other statements are true. For example, the statement \"Alex", "Elanor (e). In total, there are four assumptions about truth-telling and two about lying.\n2. Analyze the problem.\nThe problem states that we need to determine whether Elanor tells the truth based on", "two about Michaela (m), but no assumptions about Elanor.\n2. Use the assumptions to determine the truth values of the statements.\nAccording to the assumptions:\n(a) Sherrie tells the truth\n(b)", "two about Michaela (m), but there is only one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Draw the implications.\nThe implications are the statements that follow from the assumptions. The following are the implications:\n(a) s", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (E).\n2. Deduce.\nStarting with the assumptions, we can deduce the following facts:\nFrom (a) and (b): v is true\nFrom", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to reason about the world.\nHere is our reasoning:\n(a) s\n(b) v\n(c) a\n(d", "two about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Determine the implications of the assumptions.\nThe next step is to work out what each assumption means in terms of the world. For example, (a", "one about each of Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Determine the relationship between the assumptions.\nThe assumptions are connected to each other in a series of implications:\n(a) s\n(b)", "two about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Derive the truth values of the statements.\nThe truth values of the statements are derived by using the following rules:\n(i) If P,", "Michaela (m) and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Deduce the truth or lies of each person mentioned based on the assumptions.\nThe assumptions give you information about whether each person tells the truth or lies. You", "two about Michaela (m). Notice that if you assume that Sherrie is truthful, then Vernell is truthful, and if you assume Alexis is lying, then Michaela is lying.\n2. Identify the contradictions.", "Michaela (m) and only one about Elanor (e).\n2. Map the assumptions\nWe can map these assumptions as follows:\n(s) -> (v)\n(v) -> (m)\n(m)", "two about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the implications of the assumptions.\nThe implications are the things that the assumptions entail. For example, from the assumption that Sherrie tells the", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Deduce the statements that must be true.\nBy examining these assumptions, we can deduce the following statements:\n(a) If Sherrie tells", "Michaela (m), and only one about Elanor (e). That means that if you have evidence that (s) is true then you also have evidence that (v) is true, and if you have evidence that (a) is", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Analyze the implications.\nThe implications are the conclusions that we can draw from the assumptions. For example, if Sherrie is telling the truth, then Vern", "two about Michaela (m). Elanor (e) has only one assumption. This means that the assumptions are spread fairly evenly throughout the statements.\n2. Identify the logical implications.\nThe following are the logical implications:", "two assumptions about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e). This creates a symmetry of information about the characters involved. No assumption is unique to one character.\n2. Identify the truth-telling relationships.\nUnderstanding the", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relevant implications.\nThe implications are the statements that follow from the given assumptions.\n(a) If Sherrie tells the truth, then Vernell", "two about Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relationships between the assumptions.\nThe statements (b), (d), and (e) tell us that if any of the first two statements", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the relationships.\nThe second step is to analyze the relationships between the statements above. The following are the relationships:\n(a) If s is true", "two about Michaela (m). This symmetry suggests that the question might lead to a symmetrical solution.\n2. Check for symmetry.\nLook at the second and fourth statements.\n(b) Vernell says Sherrie tells the truth", "Michaela (m), and two about Elanor (e). There are also two assumptions about Sherrie (s) and two about Vernell (v).\n2. Write down the conclusions.\nThe conclusions are the statements about the nature", "two about Michaela (m), but there is only one assumption about Elanor (e). This means that to get a definitive answer, we need information about Sherrie, Vernell, Alexis, and Michaela that is independent of", "two about Michaela (m). There is only one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Use the assumptions to figure out what must be true.\nWe want to know if Elanor is telling the truth, so we need", "two about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Link the statements together.\nIn order to determine the truth value of Elanor's statement, we must determine the truth value of the other statements. This", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n2. Figure out which statements depend on which other statements.\nThe following statements depend on which other statements:\n(a) v(s)\n(b) a", "one about each of the other speakers, including Elanor (E).\n2. Analyze the connections.\nThe connections are the statements of logical consequence among the assumptions. The following are the connections:\n(s) -> (v", "Michaela (m), and one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the implications.\nThe implications are the statements that follow as a result of the assumptions.\nFrom (a): s\nFrom (b): v", "Elanor (e).\n2. Analyze the statements made by each person.\nBy using the information we have, we can make some inferences about the statements made by each person:\n(a) Sherrie's statement", "two about Michaela (m). The assumptions about Sherrie and Vernell are positive, while those about Alexis and Michaela are negative.\n2. Use the assumptions to derive the conclusions\nIf s is true, then v is true.", "Michaela (m), but only one about Elanor (e).\nAll of the assumptions must be checked against each other to see if they are mutually consistent.\n2. Check for consistency.\nThe assumptions must be consistent with each", "Michaela (m), but only one assumption about Elanor (e).\n2. Identify the implications.\nThe implications are the things that follow from the assumptions. In this case the implications are:\n(a) v\n(", "two about Michaela (m) and Elanor (e).\n2. Deduce relationships among the statements.\nLook at the relationships among the statements, both directly stated (the 'says' statements) and indirect (the '", "two about Michaela (m), and two about Elanor (e).\n2. Figure out what you are trying to prove.\nYou want to prove or disprove the statement: \u201cElanor tells the truth\u201d.\n3", "Michaela (m), and one about Elanor (e).\n\n2. Analyze the interactions between individuals.\nThis involves finding out what each person says about the others, and what they each say about themselves.\n(a"], "bbh:snarks": ["live.\n\nStep 1: To determine which statement is sarcastic, we first need to understand what sarcasm is.
